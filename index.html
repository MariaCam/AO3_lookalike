        <p>In our latest series of deploys, we made several improvements 
            to searching and filtering, cleaned up a whole bunch of 
            broken links, and made some finicky, but necessary changes 
            under the hood to upgrade Ruby to the latest version.</p>

            Groups Closure - What You Can Do</a>

        <p>Yahoo! has announced that Yahoo Groups will be permanently 
            closing, and deleting all previously posted material on 
            December 14, 2019. Some of you may be wondering what you 
            can do to preserve fannish content posted to Yahoo Groups 
            before it is deleted, and what the Organization for 
            Transformative Works can do to help.</p>
